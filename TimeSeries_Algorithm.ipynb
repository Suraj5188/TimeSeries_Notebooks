        "A **time series roadmap** is a structured plan for analyzing, modeling, and forecasting time series data. Time series data consists of observations collected over time, often at regular intervals (e.g., daily stock prices, monthly sales, hourly temperature readings). The roadmap provides a step-by-step guide to handle time series data effectively, from data collection to deployment of predictive models. Below is a detailed explanation of the **time series roadmap** and its key components.\n",
